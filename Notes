Python Data Science - Machine Learning (Notes)

• Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance .
   over time.
• In ML, machine is intelligent and can make it's own decision.

• SuperVised Learning: 
                     Target columns and features are both present. It uses Labeled Data and easily do predictions and create models using both input and output data. There are 2 types of supervised learning:
 
(A) Classification: 
                Target column is categorical. Machine Learning Classification helps us to make predictions and decisions based on data.

• Types of Classification Metrics:
    (I) Confusion Metrics:
                         Confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm. It consists of four metrics:

                             True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).

(II) Accuracy: 
            Accuracy is a fundamental metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models. It measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances.

 (B) Regression: 
                Target column contains continuous values.

• Unsupervised Leaning: 
                    Target column is not given. It uses Unlabeled Data. It groups and interprets data based only on input data. There is 1 type of unsupervised learning:
 (A) Clustering :

• Reinforcement Learning: 
                        It contains agents which will take a set of decisions and select the best one and perform learning on the basis of the selected decision.
• .fit is used to load data to model so it can read it.

• Confusion Metrics:
                    A confusion matrix is a matrix that summarizes the performance of a machine learning model on a set of test data.
It displays number of accurate and inaccurate results based on models prediction of test data.
